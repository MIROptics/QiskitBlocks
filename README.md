# QiskitBlocks
Teaches quantum computing and Qiskit in a Minetest block world. 
- Here are the [Quantum Computing Workshop with QiskitBlocks web-based slides](https://slides.com/javafxpert/qiskitblocks).
- Watch a [video that gives a gentle introduction to quantum computing using cats and QiskitBlocks](https://vimeo.com/415175316)
- See a QiskitBlocks tour in the [Learn how to play and build a Minetest-based game using Qiskit](https://youtu.be/kmCSxfrK_Mg) from IBM Q. 

Please choose one of the *Installing and running* options below and follow the instructions.

## Installing and running (the quick and easy way using the Minetest Content Database)
- Download, install and run [Minetest 5.2](https://www.minetest.net/). Note: This site has a preferred alternative to MacOS Homebrew installation: https://www.techspot.com/downloads/5585-minetest.html

- Click the `Content` tab shown here, then click the `Browse online content` button. 
![Minetest Content Tab](https://github.com/JavaFXpert/QiskitBlocks/raw/master/minetest_content_tab.png)

- When on the page shown here, type `QiskitBlocks`, click the `Search` button, and click the `Install` button beside the `QiskitBlocks` row. Click the `Back to Main Menu` button when installation has completed.

- For QiskitBlocks to work correctly, HTTP requests must be allowed for one of its core components. To do this, go to the `Settings` menu. Click on `All Settings`.

- First enter `HTTP mods` into the search bar and then click the `Search` button. Select the row containing `HTTP mods` and click on the `Edit` button.

- Enter `q_command` and click the `Save` button.

- Leave the `All Settings` menu by clicking on the `Back to Settings page` button.

- Although Minetest typically uses your computer's default language, you must select a language in Minetest for QiskitBlocks messages to be displayed in your desired language. Currently, QiskitBlocks messages have been translated to Japanese, so please refer to the [Selecting a language](https://github.com/JavaFXpert/QiskitBlocks#selecting-a-language) section below for instructions.

- Click the `Start Game` tab shown here, select the round `QiskitBlocks` game from the lower left, deselect the three checkboxes, and click the `New` button.

- From the *new world* dialog shown here, make up a world name with characters and underscores, enter `0` in the `Seed` field, select `singlenode` or `flat` in the `Mapgen` field, and click the `Create` button.

- Click the `Play Game` button, waiting a few seconds while the new world is generated and lighted.

## Selecting a language
Due to the great translation work of [Kifumi Numata](https://twitter.com/kifuminumata) , you may choose for QiskitBlocks messages to be displayed in Japanese (`ja`). To accomplish this, take the following steps: 

- From the `Settings` tab, click the `All Settings` button:
![Minetest All Settings](https://github.com/JavaFXpert/QiskitBlocks/raw/master/minetest_all_settings_button.png)

- Click `Client and Server` to expand it, then click `language`. Click the edit button, select `ja` from the dropdown list, and click the `Save` button. After clicking the `< Back to Settings page` button, exit Minetest and run it again so that your language selection takes effect in QiskitBlocks messages:

## Explore and learn!
- When you're in the starting room with all of the quantum operation blocks on the wall, use the W, A, S, D keys to walk up to the sign on the right side of the door. Right-click the sign and follow the instructions. Have fun exploring and solving quantum circuit puzzles! 

Please reach out to James Weaver on Qiskit Slack (located at [qiskit.org](http://qiskit.org)) with questions or feedback.
